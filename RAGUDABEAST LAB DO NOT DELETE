<p>
There are lots of dogs. My favorite type of dog is the german shepeard. There are upsides and downsides of having a german shepard. The upsides are that they are used in police chases. Unlike us humans, dogs can smell something left by the robber, take the robber's smell in it's body, and find him. The downsides are that they get injured easily so we need to be carful of how we take care of them.
