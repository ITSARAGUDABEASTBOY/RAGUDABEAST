My  favorite dog type
 <h1>Summary about dogs</h1>  <p> <p style="color:white"> My favorite type of dog is a german shepard. There are upsides and downsides of having a german shepard. The upsides are that they are used in police chases. Unlike us humans, dogs can smell something left by the robber, take the robber's smell in it's body, and find him. The downsides are that they get injured easily so we need to be careful of how we take care of them.m.
